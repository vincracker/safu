            These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and use
            https://safusend.xyz, a website-hosted user interface (the “Interface” or “App”){" "}
            <b>provided by SafuSend (“we”, “our”, or “us”). </b>You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs
            your use of the Interface. By accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand,
            and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to
            access or use the Interface and should not use the Interface.{" "}

              This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class
              action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The Interface is only
              available to you — and you should only access the Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.

            <p className="font-bold">Introduction</p>
            <p>
              The Interface provides access to (a) a decentralized smart contract on various public blockchains,
              including but not limited to Ethereum, that allow users to transfer certain compatible digital assets
              (“the SafuSend protocol” or the “Protocol”). To access the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet
              software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial
              wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Agreement.
              Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control
              over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting
              your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated
              herein by reference.

            <p className="font-bold">Description of Services provided through the Interface</p>
            <p className="font-bold">a. Interface for accessing Protocol</p>
            <p>
              The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the
              Protocol. The Protocol itself has three versions, designated as v1, v2, and v3, each of which comprises
              open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public
              blockchains, such as Ethereum. SafuSend does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any
              blockchain network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital
              assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution
              on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the
              Protocol. As a general matter, Labs is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and
              liquidity providers are independent third parties. The Protocol was initially deployed on the Ethereum
              blockchain, and has since been deployed on several other blockchain networks including by parties other
              than SafuSend. Deployments on other networks typically make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets
              native to one blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets that
              have been “bridged” or “wrapped” to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains
              compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain can
              effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to as “Layer 2”
              solutions) are distinct from the original Ethereum mainnet asset.

            <p className="font-bold">Eligibility</p>
            <p>
              To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly,
              you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the
              United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and
              conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may
              access or use the Interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or
              enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted
              parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the
              U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory
              that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the
              United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of the Interface will fully comply with all
              applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use the Interface to conduct, promote, or
              otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
